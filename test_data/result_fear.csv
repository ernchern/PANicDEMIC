2020-06-15 13:05:25,@Namaste76442420 Same thing is happening in Brazil I'm afraid and just a heads up: The numbers of death due to it are in general fake! It doesn't matter the reason you died but it's Covid 19. Most hospitals in Sao Paulo are empty while organ trafficking is also happening and being sent to China.
2020-06-15 13:01:25,@alrightPET @sarah_blagden @eileen_parkes I‚Äôm afraid that switching resource to Covid 19 has cost CRUK lots of support from its fundraisers

2020-06-15 17:45:21,"Dear Government,

In a time of heightened tension, fear and loss. Nothing panics the country more than watching Dominic Raab give a nation wide address on COVID-19 solo. Or hearing him give medical, scientific advice to the people. Terrifying.
